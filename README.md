# Supermarket-cashier
This is a beginner-friendly Python project that simulates a simple cashier system for a supermarket. The program allows users to input products and their quantities, automatically calculates the total bill using predefined prices, and applies discounts based on customer membership type (Gold, Silver, or Bronze).
